    <p>
      A <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong>, currently living in Belgrade,
      Serbia but originally from a small and beautiful country named Macedonia.
      Even though I passed a quarter of a century (aged
      {{ new Date().getFullYear() - 1994 }}), I feel more
      <strong>alive and energized</strong> than ever. Devoted to my mission to
      <strong>inspire and motivate people to do better</strong>, I always try to
      be kind, humble and give back to the people around me. Having people
      around me that care about both my successes and failures, accomplishing
      the tasks that I set for myself, achieving long term goals, putting
      efforts into preserving our environment are some of the
      <strong>things that make me happy.</strong>

      <strong

      in March 2018. At the moment, I am attending my
      <strong>master studies for Software Engineering</strong> at the same
      university. Keeping my skills sharp and up to date is my everyday goal. I
      usually do that by taking courses, reading books or building stuff.

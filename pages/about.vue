    <h3 class="text-2xl mb-4">Let me introduce myself! ðŸ‘‹</h3>
    <p>
      I'm a <strong>Senior Software Engineer</strong> currently living in
      Skopje, Macedonia, aged {{ new Date().getFullYear() - 1994 }}. Devoted to
      my mission to <strong>inspire and motivate people to do better</strong>, I
      always try to be kind, humble, and give back to the people around me.
      Having people around me who care about my successes and failures,
      accomplishing the tasks that I set for myself, achieving long-term goals,
      and putting efforts into preserving our environment are
      <strong>things that make me happy.</strong>

      I have completed my
      <strong>master's studies in Software Engineering</strong> at the

        University of Belgrade
      </a>
      in September 2021. Keeping my skills sharp and up to date is my everyday
      goal. I usually do that by taking courses, reading books, or building
      stuff.
